Bilal kashif : stock price of iphone
Jarvis : I think there might be some confusion! iPhones are products manufactured by Apple Inc., and as such, they don't have a stock price. Apple Inc. is a publicly traded company, and its stock price is available under the ticker symbol AAPL.
If you're looking for the price of a specific iPhone model, it would depend on the region, storage capacity, and condition of the device. iPhone prices can vary depending on the retailer, and they're not traded on a stock exchange.
If you could provide more context or clarify what you're looking for, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
